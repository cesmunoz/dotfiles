# dotfiles

This repo is for setting up my general dotfiles and vim config for Ubuntu and Windows.
The first time setup can be automated with:

> bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesmunoz/dotfiles/master/install.sh)

## Troubleshooting

Since the script uses nvm. You need to run two times the script.  
After the first time, need to restart the console.
