# Dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles and all the configurations I use on my computers.
Here we have the configuration for Mac and Arch linux.

In the Cross-platform we will have some common tools and tools/apps/configuration specific to each OS

## ðŸš€ Installation

Clone the repo into `~/dev`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dev/cm
git clone https://github.com/cesmunoz/dotfiles.git ~/dev/cm/dotfiles
cd ~/dev/cm/dotfiles
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer will:

- Detect the operating system (macOS or Arch Linux)
- Ensure gum and other dependencies are installed (depending on the os)
- Install a small set of core tools (zsh, neovim, etc).
- Stow the dotfiles into $HOME
- Apply OS-specific steps:
  - macOS
  - Arch
